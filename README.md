# Bike Share Analysis Project

This project analyzes bike-sharing data to discover user behavior and trends in bike-sharing services. Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, the project explores data, cleans and preprocesses it, and visualizes key insights about users of the bike-sharing system.

## Project Overview

The dataset includes information such as user type (subscriber or customer), trip duration, start and end time, as well as the start and end station. The goal of the analysis is to understand user behavior, identify patterns, and generate insights that can help improve bike-sharing services.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset and identify the key features.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and clean the data for analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Create visualizations to understand the relationships between variables.
- **Analysis**: Use descriptive statistics and other analytical methods to uncover insights.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Wrangling
- Data Visualization
- Descriptive Statistics
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files

- `Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `Bike_Share_Analysis.html`: A static HTML version of the analysis for easy viewing.

## Conclusion

The project provides insights into the bike-sharing system, including peak usage times, user preferences, and patterns in ride duration. These insights can help bike-sharing companies optimize their services to meet the needs of their users.
